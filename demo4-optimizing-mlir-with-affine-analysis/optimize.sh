# One optimization we can perform is loop fusion. The kernel we are optimizing
# has two loops with similar iteration loops. The Affine dialect is able to
# analyze the memory access patterns of these two loops and recognize that they
# can be fused safely. This cannot be done in the loops dialect, since it cannot
# be certain that the loops are independent. The benefit of loop fusion in this
# case is that it removes the allocation of a 1MB memref! Beyond just saving
# memory, the reduces the memory footprint of the entire kernel which can
# improve cache locality.

# Speaking of cache locality, tiling is another technique used to improve the
# cache locality. My computer has an L2 cache size of 1MiB, which is around
# 1024 kB. We can tell the affine-loop-tile pass that we have this cache size
# and it will tile the loops to optimize the core parts of the code to have a
# footprint of 1024 kB.
# Note: This can make the MLIR code look very strange since it does some
#       weirdness with the induction variables. To make it more readible for
#       this tutorial, I normalize and canonicalize everything.
