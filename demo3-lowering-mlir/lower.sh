# Lower tensors to memrefs. Since we plan on targeting CPUs, we cannot stay at
# the tensor abstraction since every chunk of data needs to have an allocated
# buffer somewhere in memory. We can make use of the one-shot-bufferize pass
# in MLIR to convert the Tensors into MemRefs. MemRefs are practically wrappers
# around allocated pointers to memory with shape information.

# Convert the linalg operations into loops in the SCF dialect. We are assuming
# that our target device cannot compute MatMul and ReLU directly; so we convert
# these kernels into loops. This is a lower level of abstraction than the linalg
# algorithms themselves and closer to what a CPU can execute.

# to represent loops. We lower the loops in our kernel into branches; further
# lowering the control flow abstraction to as close to CPUs as we can.

# Finally, we convert everything to the LLVM dialect. We have lowered the
# abstraction of the data and control flow low enough that we can convert
# basically one-to-one to the LLVM dialect. We target LLVM here since LLVM
# contains standard backend code which can generate real assembly for the kernel
# we wrote.

# This LLVMIR code can then be further optimized and lowered into assembly code
# to run on a CPU. This is not shown for this tutorial.
